# 🧱 Topology Optimization

This project explores how machine learning and deep learning models can be applied to **material topology optimization** and failure prediction using synthetic stress-strain datasets.

📌 The goal is to model failure conditions in materials using:
- Traditional ML classifiers
- Deep neural networks
- Preprocessing, visualization, and optimization methods
